# TwoActiveWorldsTestProject

This project tries to run two HybridRenderer at the same time. It works, but only one HybridRenderer is really rendering to the screen

Look into TestManager.cs and TestSystem.cs. The customBootstrap is empty, to ensure we do everything correctly by hand

By pressing T you enable/disable only HybridRenderer of World1  
By pressing Z you enable/disable only HybridRenderer of World2  
By pressing U you enable/disable both HybridRenderers
